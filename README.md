# Web report in Powershell
 
## Overview
In this PowerShell script, I have used .csv file to convert to HTML Table. 

## Purpose of the script
The script converts the csv file into HTML and send it out by using email. Many people does not have excel on their phone to open the attachment and review it. It is much easier to review the report in email because the report does not need to be open in separate app.
